## Set Up Environment
- Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
- After Anaconda installation, open Anaconda Prompt
- In Anaconda prompt install metapy: $ pip install metapy
- In Anaconda prompt install Flask: $ pip install Flask
- Download the Travelate application in desired directory: https://github.com/attrivivek/Travelate
- In Anaconda prompt change directory to the application (assuming in root of Travelate app): /webpage/
- In Anaconda prompt: $ set FLASK_APP=app.py (Windows) or export FLASK_APP=app.py (Mac)
- In Anaconda prompt: $ python -m flask run
- Visit: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
- Enter Query and Search
- View Results

*** If using Windows you may need to set up your PATH variables for installed items. You can do this in 'System Properties' -> 'Advanced' -> 'Environment Variables' -> 'Path' (Under 'System Variables') -> 'New' -> Paste path to the desired .exe file downloaded if not using pip install. If installing with Anaconda the installations will be a part of the Anaconda path, which should already be set when installing Anaconda. Hence why Anaconda is preferred to run this application.

## Features
- Original Database used: https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe/home
- Search hotels in 6 countries using a query from the initial input box. Countries include Netherlands, Austria, France, Italy, Kingdom (United Kingdom), or Spain.
- A set of results are returned in response to the query. The inofrmation listed for each result is Hotel Name, Hotel Address, Average Score, and Number of Reviews.
- Each reasult is also linked to a search result for thst hotel in Google. SO by clicking a result item the user will be taken to a search result page for that hotel item.
- The result page will also have a button that allows the user to go back to the input page to search using a new query.

## Pre-Processing
The following steps had taken place to get the original dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe/home to the one used in the application:
- Select Variables of Interest, which for this application were the following: Hotel Address, Tags, Reviewer Score, Total Reviews, Hotel Name, Average Score, Negative Review, Positive Review, Days Since Review, Negative Review Score, Positive Review Score
- Normalize the Average Score and the Reviewer Score
- Transform data, like days since review from a string to an integer or tags from a string into an array
- Choose 10,000 observations for each of the 6 countries at random (slim down dataset size to 60,000 from the original 515,000)
- Remove reviews in the positive and negative reviews columns that were adding no value. Examples include the following: none, no, nil, nothing, none at all, etc.
- Run the reviews columns through a sentiment analysis scoring algorithm
- Normalize the Negative reviews columns to be between -1 and 0 and Positive reviews columns to be between 0 and 1
